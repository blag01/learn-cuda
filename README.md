# Welcome

This is a history of my learning CUDA. 
Initially, I solved leetgpu problems.
Since I am learning as I go, solutions are definitely not meant to be optimal but rather build up on my existing knowledge and understanding of CUDA. Hopefully, later commits demonstrate a higher understanding (or I should just give up).

# Interested in working together?

I love ML research and algorithmic engineering alike. If you are interested in working with me, please reach out (here, LinkedIn, email, etc).
